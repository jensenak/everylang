12/23/15 - I've already finished this one, but thought I'd add some comments after. I've had a variety of experience with Python. First as a tech support guy, writing scripts. Later in Ops roles, and finally in development. I like Python, but I don't like how nitpicky people get about what's "pythonic". I dislike duck-typing. It irritates me. Generally, I find it to be a very useful language and will continue to choose it for many projects.

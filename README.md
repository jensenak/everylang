This is a project in which I will attempt to write a simple program in as many different languages as possible. 

Goals: 

* Include some form of data associated with methods (object-like)
* Include an iterative loop
* Use two types of non-loop control flow statements (if/else, switch, select, etc)
* Implement user input and related output
* If possible, generate an error and handle it
